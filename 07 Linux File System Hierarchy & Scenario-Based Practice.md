# Linux File System Hierarchy – 

## Core Directories (Must Know)

### `/` (root) - The starting point of everything  
**Contains:** It is the top-level directory that contains all subdirectories.  
**I would use this when:** I want to see what the root directory contains and navigate to core directories.

## Additional Directories

### `/bin` - Essential command binaries  
**Contains:** It contains essential binaries like cat, ls, systemctl, etc.  
**I would use this when:** I want to run basic system commands.

## Part 2: Scenario-Based Practice

### Scenario 1: Service Not Starting

<img width="1632" height="976" alt="s1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22d88a4-539a-4298-9452-2626153b94a6" />
<img width="1873" height="985" alt="s12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de85585f-09c2-4d51-a308-1a7742bba958" />

**Step 1:** systemctl status myapp  
**Why:** It shows the status of `myapp`

**Step 2:** systemctl is-enabled myapp  
**Why:** It shows whether the service is enabled or disabled.  

**Step 3:** sudo journalctl -u myapp -n 50  
**Why:** Checks logs to understand why the service failed.  

**Step 4:** sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
**Why:** Reloads systemd after configuration changes.  

**Step 5:** sudo systemctl start myapp  
**Why:** Starts the service again.
